<h1 align="center">Mowblox smart contract learning projects</h1>

[buildspace](https://buildspace.so) was built on these projects. it's been awesome to see so many people excited to check out something we created. we are starting to move away from these projects and beginning something much bigger which you can checkout [here](https://buildspace.so). with that said --
### we are currently not supporting or adding any new projects here.
we know a lot of you are still going through these projects and want to go through more. keep reading for more info:

**can I still go through projects?**<br>
yup. just head to https://buildspace.so/builds or https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects and you can access them like you normally would

**are there going to be any new projects added?**<br>
nope. there are no plans for adding new projects to buildspace

**will you all still be accepting PRs?**<br>
while we want to keep track of all the PRs that come through, it's really hard for us to keep up right now. if you have a PR that is game changing email us at `support@buildspace.so` and let us know!

**can I use this content for something I'm working on?**<br>
most definitely! feel free to use it, but make sure to reference it was content generated by buildspace :).

**how can I keep up to date with buildspace?**<br>
head to https://buildspace.so and apply :)

thank you **all** for making this place amazing. shout out to all the contributors listed below, we couldn't have gotten this for without you!
